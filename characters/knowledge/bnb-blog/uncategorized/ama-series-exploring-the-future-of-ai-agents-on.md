Hello! I am El, cofounder of Jam. Jam is a community focused on the creator economy. We provide everyone with the ability to create their own AI Agent without any coding, to help with creating content and engaging their communities. The community token is $JAM and more details are available at ai.jam.so. Follow us on x.com/jamfrens.

Q2. How is Jam AI making its AI Agents accessible to users who might not have a technical background in blockchain or AI? What initiatives are in place to drive adoption?

Jam helps users to create AI Agent without any coding. User can simply engage JamAI (warpcast.com/jamai) through a cast, and JamAI will guide the user through the creation process.

User will need an account on warpcast.com, a leading decentralized social network.

We are looking to bring this capability of chat-to-create AI Agent over to x.com and users will simply have to engage x.com/jamfrens through tweets.

Behind our powerful AI Agent creation, we have partnered and are working with ElizaOS. This partnership ensures we work with a leading AI Agent framework that will continue to be upgraded for our users.

In order to create an AI Agent using JamAI, the wallet associated with the Farcaster account must hold at least 300,000 $JAM. More about rules of engagement here.

Q3. How is Jam AI's decentralized AI platform different from other blockchain-based AI platforms?

Jam offers code-less creation of AI Agent through chats. Users can tag JamAI (warpcast.com/jam) and it will chat through casts, then advise user on the creation of the AI agent. You can follow JamAI and our channel.

At the same time, JamAI is capable of launching a ticker/token on BNB chain associated with the AI agent. The creator can garner sponsorship for the agent, where people can patronize on ai.jam.so.

Once an AI Agent gets 60 sponsors, it will graduate with (I) conversational AI capability and (II) deployment of token into a liquidity pool on Pancake Swap. This makes it really easy for creators. All they have to do is the create, inform the community and get their support! Check out the rule of engagement here.

Q4. In what ways can creators and users collaborate to build AI applications on the Jam AI blockchain ecosystem?

Jam simplifies the creation of AI Agent for any creators or users. Once the AI Agent goes live, it can help the creator with content creation in a community, engagement and other automation in future. We also welcome creators of these AI Agents to collaborate with Jam to run campaigns and future their own communityâ€™s agenda with the AI Agents.

Q5. How can users leverage on your platform to create AI Agents?

We will be deploying the AI Agent creation ability on x.com soon.

In 2025, Jam will continue to experiment AI Agent x Social use cases! We will first upgrade our agents to be able to make posts and replies autonomously.

Thereafter, we will be deploying the AI Agent creation ability on x.com soon.

In Q2025, we will also introduce the mechanism to unlock $JAM airdrop that early supporters have received.

We are excited about 2025 as we improve the AI Agent capabilities and push these features to AI Agent created by users through JamAI.

Q7. What are some last words you want to share with the community? Feel free to share your socials.

We are excited about the prospect of AI Agent x Social in 2025. More importantly, the close collaboration with BNB Chain, ElizaOS and Farcaster to realize our AI Agent plan has been amazing!

We see how launching AI Agents with tickers are changing the lives of creators, improving how they create, engagement and reward the community.

I also want to thank the audience in the AMA, and do follow us for latest alphas and updates.
