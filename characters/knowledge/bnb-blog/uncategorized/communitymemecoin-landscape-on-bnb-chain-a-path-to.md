BNB Chain recently achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 500 million unique active addresses. This achievement follows the launch of TST, an (unintended) meme coin created as part of a tutorial video demonstrating how to create a meme coin on the Four.Meme launchpad platform on BNB Chain. While TST has recently grabbed the spotlight as an accidental poster child of BNB Chain’s meme coin ecosystem, it’s important to recognize that other memecoins have been steadily growing their communities and making a significant impact on BNB Chain.

This article will delve into the latest developments of notable meme coins on BNB Chain and explore the tools and opportunities available for anyone looking to create the next viral cultural artifact for their community.

Since October 2024, BNB Chain has hosted over four rounds of memecoin innovation competitions, distributing more than $200k in incentives across 11 different projects. In December 2024, to celebrate the rise of memecoins on both BNB Chain and opBNB, BNB Chain purchased the top-performing memecoin each day with 33 BNB, which was then airdropped to 1000 lucky eligible BNB and CAKE holders. This initiative ran for 14 days, showcasing the growing importance of memecoins in the ecosystem. Earlier in 2024, BNB Chain also dedicated a $900K liquidity pool to support and develop the meme coin ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to this vibrant vertical.

DappBay currently lists over 140 active memecoins on BNB Chain, with a significant surge in market activity. Some memecoins have been able to tap into BNB Smart Chain’s growing user base, which now exceeds 1.2 million daily active users (DAU). The community's enthusiasm for memecoins on BNB Chain is clear, with many projects finding support in different ways. Several memecoin projects have even achieved notable milestones in the broader crypto landscape, including listings on major exchanges:
