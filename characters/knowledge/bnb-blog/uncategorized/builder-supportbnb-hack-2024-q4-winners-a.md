The 2024 Q4 BNB Hack, known as the “Ultimate Battle of Hacker Heroes,” has come to a close, and we’re excited to celebrate the groundbreaking innovations that emerged during this quarter’s event. With a prize pool of over $458,000, we’ve received over 200 applications. The hackathon brought together some of the brightest minds in Web3 development, providing a platform for creativity and cutting-edge solutions.

Out of 204 submissions, 10 projects were selected to advance to the demo round and compete for the top three spots. You can watch the hackathon Top 10 demo day here.

The BNB Hack Series is just one of the initiatives BNB Chain leads to offer builders enhanced opportunities and visibility. In addition, BNB Chain provides other exciting programs such as our TVL Incentive Program, designed to encourage liquidity growth, the Memecoin Innovation initiative to drive creativity in the memecoin space, and our newly launched AI Agent Solutions, including the upcoming AI Hackathon. These programs aim to support innovation and foster growth across various verticals within the Web3 ecosystem.

The Q4 Hackathon is open to unrestricted creativity, fostering the best innovation without a specific theme or wishlist. Instead, we've curated tracks aligned with current market trends and BNB Chain’s strategic focus, including:

These tracks aim to drive real business impact and onboard the next billion users to BNB Chain and we believe the following winners embody such characteristics.

We are thrilled to announce the top winners of the BNB Hack 2024 Q4!

Outrun: Outrun is a trailblazer in next-generation DeFi and Web3, featuring four core modules: OutStake, OutSwap, FFLaunch, and Memeverse. Together, these modules offer yield tokenization, liquid staking derivatives, decentralized exchanges, novel token financing paradigms, and Memecoin staking, creating a comprehensive ecosystem.

OutStake introduces a revolutionary staking model using yield-bearing tokens, enabling users to unlock liquidity and earn higher returns with features like Principal Tokens (PT), interest-rate-linked stablecoins (YT), universal principal tokens (UPT), and position option tokens (POT). OutSwap enhances AMMs with native yield capture, customizable fee tiers, and referral incentives. FFLaunch provides a fair, risk-free launchpad, ensuring equitable token distribution and reduced investor risk, while Memeverse extends these innovations to Memecoin issuance and staking with unique features like ERC4626-compliant staking vaults and viral community growth mechanisms.

These interconnected modules form a robust and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem, blending yield tokenization, liquidity solutions, and decentralized innovations. Outrun’s comprehensive design empowers users and projects alike, fostering transparency, security, and sustainability in Web3.

The platform operates on a smart contract, ensuring fair and automated processes for submission, voting, and reward distribution.

Users can manage their wallets, view transaction history, and test payment flows using intuitive commands such as /addwallet, /buy, and /history. The platform is designed for convenience and reliability, making it accessible for anyone looking to turn their in-app rewards into crypto assets.

With future plans to launch on mainnets and develop the innovative StarGas Feature, Star Bridge aims to expand its functionality by enabling users to sign transactions or mint NFTs using Telegram Stars.
