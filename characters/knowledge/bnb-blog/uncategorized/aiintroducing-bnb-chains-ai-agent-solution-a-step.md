We are excited to announce the launch of the AI Agent Solution on BNB Chain, an initiative designed to simplify the creation and deployment of decentralized AI agents.

An AI agent is an autonomous, software-based entity that uses artificial intelligence to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. This development represents a step forward in merging AI capabilities with Web3 technology, and we’re eager to see the community explore its potential.  This development represents a step forward in merging AI capabilities with Web3 technology, and we’re eager to see the community explore its potential.

The solution provides developers with tools and resources to design and scale AI agents for real-world applications. BNB Chain has recently introduced its AI Agents Competition, offering opportunities to spotlight promising AI-powered decentralized applications.

The AI Agent Solution empowers developers to create, scale, and monetize AI agents seamlessly for Web3 applications. At its core is a collection of customizable Agent Kits, including:

Eliza is a versatile AI agent built with a BNB Chain Plugin and contributed by NodeReal. It supports multiple LLM providers such as OpenAI, Claude, and Llama, ensuring flexibility for developers. Eliza offers native access to blockchain functionality, enabling reliable on-chain operations. Its capabilities extend to asset management, including token operations like transfers, swaps and bridge. Additionally, Eliza integrates with popular social platforms like X, Discord, and Telegram, maintaining consistent personalities across channels. It also features a RAG memory system for document processing, media analysis, and autonomous trading.

ShellAgent is an open and modular Agentic Framework developed by MyShell. It simplifies AI agent creation with a no-code Classic Mode, which is ideal for beginners. The framework supports multi-model agents, integrating capabilities from LLM and AIGC models. Once built, these agents can be hosted seamlessly on the MyShell Agent Marketplace, allowing developers to share and monetize their creations. ShellAgent’s robust design ensures flexibility and scalability for various use cases.

TermiX provides users with a diverse range of pluggable agent components, enabling custom workflows tailored to specific needs. It supports low-code creation through intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, making it beginner-friendly. True on-chain operations are a hallmark of TermiX, as its open-source DeFAI Agent Kits interact directly with blockchain networks without intermediaries. Developers can also tokenize their agents and establish pricing models, creating revenue opportunities from their innovations.

Revox.ai focuses on simplifying the creation of AI-Web3 applications, making them accessible to developers of all levels. It includes an Agent Marketplace that fosters collaboration and monetization of AI agents. Revox.ai agents are equipped for on-chain transactions and smart contract interactions, leveraging a rich plugin ecosystem for enhanced functionality and faster development. Its low-code approach ensures a streamlined development process for users of varying technical expertise.

The platform also offers several launchpad options for users to create and explore AI agents:

To complement the AI Agent Solution, BNB Chain has introduced two initiatives to inspire creativity and adoption:

The launch of the AI Agent Solution and its accompanying initiatives reflects BNB Chain’s commitment to nurturing a collaborative and innovative ecosystem. By providing developers with practical tools and opportunities, we hope to unlock the potential of decentralized AI applications together.

Whether you’re a seasoned developer or new to AI, we invite you to explore these solutions and join us in shaping the future of AI on BNB Chain.
