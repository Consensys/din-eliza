Starting February 18, 2025, the BNB Chain Meme Liquidity Support Program will provide memecoins with an opportunity to shine and grow within the thriving BNB Chain ecosystem. We’ll spotlight the top memecoins daily and weekly by adding BNB liquidity directly to the winning projects' pools from the BNB Chain Foundation’s wallet. This liquidity will stay in the pool permanently and won’t be withdrawn. This is the 1st round of the competition, with the upcoming rounds to be announced based on community feedback.

All memecoins natively launched on BSC and meet the following conditions:

During the competition, each memecoin will be ranked based on the following indicators and weight ratios to determine the corresponding Liquidity rewards.

Score = (Market Cap Rank × 30%) + (Price Increase Rank × 20%) + (Trading Volume Rank × 50%)

For example, if  Token A has achieved the following rankings:

After verifying the winner's benchmark, BNB Chain will announce the winner on X, and support will be completed within 5 days after the announcement of the winner.

Double-side liquidity will be added: 50% of BNB plus 50% of the memecoin (bought from the market) will be added to the most active liquidity pool.

About withdrawing liquidity: Liquidity support will remain permanently in the pool without withdrawal.
