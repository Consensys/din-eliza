Launching a new memecoin? The BNB Chain Memecoin Daily Airdrop Series is your chance to stand out and grow in the thriving BNB Chain ecosystem. From December 12 to December 19, 2024, we’re spotlighting the top memecoins daily by buying 33 BNB worth of their tokens and airdropping them to 1,000 lucky BNB and CAKE holders.

Each day, the best-performing memecoin on BSC will be selected based on three essential metrics:

The leaderboard—live from December 11—will track these metrics in real time, allowing memecoins to compete transparently. If your project claims the top spot, the BNB Chain team will purchase 33 BNB worth of your token and distribute it to 1,000 BNB and CAKE holders.

If you’ve been dreaming of launching your own memecoin, now’s the perfect time! It’s simple to get started on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) using trusted memecoin launchpads such as Four.MEME, Gra.fun, Pinksale.meme, Flap.sh, Burve, or Memehub.ai. You can read the full guide here on how to launch your memecoin.

By participating in the Memecoin Daily Airdrop Series, your project can:

BNB Chain is committed to supporting top-performing memecoins by expanding their application scenarios within the BSC ecosystem. This includes initiatives such as creating a LisUSD liquidity pool on DEX with ListaDAO, listing perpetual contracts on APX, featuring on KiloEx, integrating with the trading bot uDEX, and exploring innovative "AI x Meme" collaborations with Four.meme.

Together, let’s pave the way to success! Stay tuned for more details to be announced soon.

The airdrop is open to all BNB and CAKE holders meeting these criteria:

1. Quote share this post with your thoughts on the memes on BSC or share your favorite BSC meme on X

A snapshot of eligible wallet addresses will be taken on December 11, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC, so make sure you’re ready! Winners will be randomly selected, ensuring that every holder has an equal chance to participate in the excitement. Since there are too many holders of these two tokens, we will randomly select 1,000 lucky addresses from these holders to receive the airdrop. We will use Python to screen out these 1,000 lucky addresses and publish them on Twitter with a screening video.

The Memecoin Daily Airdrop Series is your chance to showcase your memecoin, engage the community, and lead the way in the future of BSC memecoins.

Mark your calendars and get ready to compete—your memecoin could be the next big winner!

The launch day of a memecoin is determined by its "pool creation" time, as a liquidity pool is essential for transactions and eligibility to compete.

Please note that memecoins launched during the competition period cannot participate on the same day they are launched. Instead, they will automatically qualify to compete starting the following day.

Digital assets are highly speculative and involve a significant risk of loss. The value of Meme coins is extremely volatile, and anyone who wishes to trade in any Meme coin should be prepared for the possibility of losing their entire investment.

BNB Chain is a public, decentralised, and permissionless blockchain. Participation by any project should not be seen as an endorsement or recommendation by BNB Chain. Users should assess their financial situation and risk tolerance and do their own research before participating in this competition or trading in any Meme coin participating in this competition. BNB Chain will not be held liable for any losses, damages, or issues that may arise from participating or trading in any Meme coin participating in this competition.
