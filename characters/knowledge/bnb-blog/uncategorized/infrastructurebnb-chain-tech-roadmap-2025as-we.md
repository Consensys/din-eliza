As we head into 2025, BNB Chain aims to improve transaction speed, streamline user experience, integrate artificial intelligence, and refine developer tools.

In 2024, BNB Chain implemented Parallel Ethereum Virtual Machine on opBNB and Consecutive Block Production on BSC. These enhancements were designed to improve network efficiency and scalability and paved the way for even better performance.

In 2025, BNB Chain aims to reduce transaction latency by decreasing block time from three seconds to sub-second speeds while maintaining high network throughput, and being able to process 100 million transactions per day.

In 2024, Megafuel, based on the Proposer Builder Separation mechanism of BNB Chain, was introduced to enable users to make gasless transactions on stablecoins. More than twenty-five million stablecoin gasless transactions have been processed through Megafuel, involving more than sixteen million users.

In 2025, Megafuel will be jointly developed to allow gasless for all types of user transactions from EOA addresses and enable users to pay gas fees using stablecoins or other types of BEP-20 tokens. Any individual or organization can sponsor a specific type of transaction. This is an excellent addition to the upcoming EIP-7702 based paymaster solutions, which will also be available on BNB Chain.

In 2024, utilizing the Proposer Builder Separation architecture, builder operators and wallet partners within the BNB Chain ecosystem introduced protection against the malicious maximal extractable value (MEV) for traders, particularly “Sandwich Attacks”. Most widely used wallets in the BNB Chain ecosystem, including Binance Wallet, Trust, OKX Wallet, and TokenPocket, have integrated MEV (maximal extractable value) protection features.

As sworn via the governance proposal, BNB Chain community will do everything required to eliminate malicious MEV. BSC validators will work together to introduce a better communication channel to improve block voting and block propagation. Besides, another goal is to reduce the mempool exposure to the bad players and improve the transaction circulation efficiency. This will eliminate the chance of Sandwich Attacks even further.

BNB Chain will provide the same smart wallet solution as EIP-7702, which includes:

While on this topic, we hope to see native AI agents integrated into wallets to help users manage trading and spending, from finding the best prices across different blockchains for trading to booking hotels or air tickets.

At the beginning of 2024,  the synergy between artificial intelligence and Web3 was a primary focus within the BNB Chain community. More than 60 projects have already been deployed on BNB Chain, ranging from data infrastructure and tooling to AI-driven applications.

A growing number of AI-powered applications are being developed on BNB Chain, spanning multiple industries:

In 2025, we will continuously work with BNB Chain community and leverage BSC and Greenfield to speed up several vital trends in AI:

For 2025, BNB Chain will keep optimizing and consolidating developer tools including

Last but not least, we will continue to support the meme ecosystem. We are happy to see many of the meme tool providers integrate with BNB Chain. And we will continue to work closely with them in 2025 and beyond.

The BNB Chain Tech Roadmap 2025 outlines a clear path for growth. These innovations will create a faster, more secure, and efficient blockchain ecosystem for users, developers, and enterprises. As blockchain evolves, BNB Chain’s commitment to innovation will drive the future of decentralized finance, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure.
