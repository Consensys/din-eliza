A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can trade tokens without relying on intermediaries like banks, brokers, payment processors, or other institutions.

DEXs are one of the pillars of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and have steadily grown in popularity. In fact, the monthly DEX trading volume has consistently surpassed $300B in recent months.

The three primary types of DEXs are Order Book DEXs, Automated Market Makers (AMMs), and DEX Aggregators.

Order book DEXs work pretty similar to centralized exchanges. They use an orderbook that records all the buy and sell orders. These DEXs come in two forms:

AMMs allow people to trade cryptocurrencies without needing a buyer or seller on the other side. Instead of using an order book, AMMs use "liquidity pools," which are pools of crypto assets funded by liquidity providers. These pools allow traders to swap tokens instantly, with prices automatically adjusted based on supply and demand. In return, liquidity providers earn a share of the trading fees collected from swaps.

Depending on the type of AMM used, the liquidity pools use specific algorithms to maintain the supply and demand of all the tokens in its pool.

DEX aggregators scan multiple DEXs to find the best price, lowest fees, and most efficient trade execution. They help you find the best trades across all the DEXs they track. 1inch is a very popular DEX aggregator.

The DEX ecosystem on BNB Chain includes key players like PancakeSwap and Thena.

Launched in September 2020, PancakeSwap accounts for nearly 90% of the total DEX TVL on BNB Chain, making it the leading decentralized exchange in the ecosystem. In addition to trading, it offers features like staking, yield farming, and more. The platformâ€™s native token, CAKE, is used for rewards and governance.

Thena is the second-largest DEX on the BNB Chain. The native token of the protocol is $THE.

If you are used to CEXs, jumping over to a DEX can be quite challenging. Alongside doing your own research DYOR, here are some things to keep in mind:
