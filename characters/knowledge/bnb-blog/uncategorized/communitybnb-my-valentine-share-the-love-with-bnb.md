It’s that time of the year! Valentine’s Day is just around the corner. This year, BNB Chain is bringing the love with the “BNB My Valentine” campaign. We’re giving out BNB Roses to our incredible community, both online and offline to celebrate this special occasion.

Whether you’re planning a romantic dinner, a solo self-love treat, or just want to celebrate the beauty of blockchain, BNB My Valentine has something exciting for you.

We’ve got two ways for you to get involved and win amazing prizes

Attend our offline celebrations at NFT Paris or in Bursa, Turkey.

Capture the moment in the event. Post a photo using #BNBMyValentine on social media

Add #BeMyMatchain to your post and get the chance to win two tickets to a Paris Saint Germain game, courtesy of Matchain.

Each box will reveal either a Red Rose NFT or a Golden Rose NFT.

Golden Rose NFTs are ultra-rare—only 10 exist! If you’re lucky enough to get one, you’ll receive $100 worth of BNB!

2000 rose NFT holders will get a random share from an airdrop pool of $10,000 in $ANDY tokens!

Crypto is amazing, but it’s even better when shared! Whether you’re celebrating love with someone special or enjoying the freedom of self-love, BNB My Valentine is here to make your day extra special.
