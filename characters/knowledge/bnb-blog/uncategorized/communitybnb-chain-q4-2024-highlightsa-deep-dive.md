Messari recently released its report on the “State of BNB Chain Q4 2024.” The report provides a deep dive into BNB Chain's transformative Q4 2024, highlighting notable financial growth, technical advancements, and expanding ecosystem adoption. Here are some of the key highlights.

BNB Chain had a record-setting year, with BNB’s price reaching an all-time high of $789 on Dec 7, 2024. The market cap closed Q4 at $101.09 billion, marking a 22% QoQ increase and a staggering 114% YoY increase from $47.31 billion at the start of the year.

DeFi thrived on BNB Chain, growing 53% YoY to reach $5.35 billion TVL. Although BNB’s TVL in native tokens declined 8% QoQ (from 8.3M BNB to 7.6M BNB), the increase in TVL in USD terms was largely due to BNB price appreciation.

One of the most impressive growth stories of the year was the explosion in DEX trading on BNB Chain.

BNB Chain ended 2024 as the third-largest blockchain for stablecoins, behind only Ethereum and TRON.

With record-breaking growth, technical innovations, and increased DeFi adoption, BNB Chain remains well-positioned for 2025. Another key focus for BNB Chain in 2025 is memecoin adoption. They have launched a memecoin tokenization solution, enabling anyone to easily create and launch their own memecoins.

As we move into 2025, BNB Chain’s main goal remains the same - onboarding the next billion into Web3. For an in-depth read, check out Messari’s report here.
