BNB Chain will be a key sponsor of the ETH Oxford hackathon held at the prestigious Mathematical Institute of Oxford University. As a global blockchain leader, BNB Chain is committed to fostering the growth of decentralized ecosystems. ETH Oxford provides the ideal platform to connect with one of the fastest-growing developer communities in the United Kingdom and showcase the power and versatility of building on BNB Chain. The hackathon will take place from February 7-9, 2025.

In support of the hackathon, BNB Chain will host a hacker house in Oxford, specifically for developers working on BNB Chain projects. Developers can request accommodation at the hacker house through the ETH Oxford application process.

The BNB Hacker House will host one event that will be open to public: a welcome coffee and breakfast on Saturday, February 8. Don't miss out on this opportunity to meet and mingle with fellow builders and register now on Lu.ma.

We believe innovation thrives in the absence of constraints, so we’re not setting any fixed tracks. While we’re particularly excited about two transformative areas—Decentralized Science (DeSci) and AI—developers are encouraged to explore and build freely, guided by their own research and vision.

The hackathon features a $8,000 in cash prize. The top team will be awarded a $3,000 cash prize, a direct interview for the MVB (Most Valuable Builder) Program by BNB Chain, YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs), and CoinMarketCap; along with a month of dedicated technical support. Second and third-place teams will also be generously rewarded with cash prizes and kickstart packages. Additionally, there is a special $2,000 bonus for the best project(s) built on BNB Greenfield, BNB Chain's decentralized storage network.

Best project(s) built on BNB Greenfield will earn or share $2,000

Along with the hackathon, BNB Chain will also be hosting a workshop on the Technical Differences between Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain with an Introduction to the BNB Chain Ecosystem on Saturday 8th between 12:15 PM - 1:15 PM at ETH Oxford.
