The 2024 Annual Report on BNB Chain highlights a transformative year for the ecosystem, showcasing its commitment to scalability and developer support. Major achievements include the network consolidation under the 'One BNB' multichain strategy, advancements in opBNB and Greenfield for scalability and storage, a focus on enabling BNB Chain as an AI-first chain, and the implementation of impactful initiatives like the Gas-Free Carnival and stablecoin incentives.

Ecosystem growth is reflected in a 58.2% increase in Total Value Locked (TVL), a 17.7% rise in unique addresses, and opBNB achieving 4.7 million Daily Active Users (DAU).

Security improvements on BNB Chain saw total financial losses from security breaches drop by 67%, from $162 million in 2023 to $53 million in 2024. The number of incidents also decreased by 66%. Furthermore, programs like the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) Program and BNB Incubation Alliance (BIA) further emphasize BNB Chain's role as a leading Web3 platform.

This annual report offers a closer look at the key milestones, achievements, and learnings from 2024, reflecting BNB Chain’s ongoing efforts to support developers, enhance the user experience, and contribute to the wider adoption of blockchain technology.

The BNB Chain ecosystem saw several notable upgrades and enhancements during 2024, aimed at improving performance, scalability, and user experience:

These updates reflect  BNB Chain's ongoing commitment to creating a robust, scalable platform for developers and users alike.

In 2024, opBNB and BSC demonstrated strong daily engagement, with opBNB achieving an average DAU of 4.7 million and BSC reaching 1.12 million by the end of 2024.

For opBNB, TVL increased by 27.6% to approximately $19.2 million by the end of 2024, reflecting steady adoption and activity.

In 2024, BSC’s Total Value Locked (TVL) saw remarkable growth, increasing from $3.5 billion in January to $5.5 billion by the end of 2024—a growth of 58.2%.

opBNB on the other hand saw an average of 7.1 million transactions being processed per day.

These metrics showcase the continued growth and resilience of the BNB Chain ecosystem in 2024.

The year 2024 demonstrated remarkable strides in enhancing BNB Chain's security framework, achieving a significant reduction in value loss. Compared to 2023, losses decreased by an impressive 67%, with total financial loss dropping from $162 million to $53 million.

During 2024, BNB Chain recorded losses of $53 million across 138 incidents, averaging $384,000 per incident, with a median loss aligning closely to the average. This is a stark improvement from the previous year, which reported $162 million in losses from 416 incidents, with an average loss of $389,000 per incident. The substantial drop in incident count—66% fewer cases—further underscores the effectiveness of the enhanced security measures.

The 2024 improvements reflect BNB Chain's commitment to fostering a safer and more secure blockchain ecosystem, demonstrating stability and resilience while continuing to address critical vulnerabilities.

BNB Chain has implemented several initiatives to integrate and incentivize stablecoins within its ecosystem, focusing on cost-effectiveness and ecosystem growth.

To promote affordable stablecoin transfers, BNB Chain launched the Gas-Free Carnival on September 19, 2024. This initiative eliminates gas fees for transferring or withdrawing stablecoins like USDT, FDUSD, and USDC on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and opBNB.

This campaign aims to increase stablecoin usage and provide a seamless user experience across the ecosystem.

The TVL Incentive Program encourages DeFi projects to grow their Total Value Locked (TVL), emphasizing stablecoin and BNB staking. The program offered up to $300,000 in rewards across two challenges BNB Staking Challenge and the TVL Challenge.

These efforts underline BNB Chain’s commitment to fostering stablecoin adoption and expanding its DeFi ecosystem.

The integration and incentivization of stablecoins on BNB Chain have yielded notable outcomes:

These results underscore the effectiveness of BNB Chain’s strategies in enhancing the ecosystem's appeal for stablecoin transactions and DeFi activity.

BNB Chain saw an emphasis on offering a robust platform for AI-driven applications in 2024, combining BSC’s high throughput and low transaction costs, opBNB’s rapid processing for real-time responsiveness, and BNB Greenfield’s secure, decentralized data storage.

This integrated ecosystem reduces operational costs, enabling scalable and dynamic AI solutions while ensuring trust and privacy for users. Developers benefit from a streamlined environment to build advanced AI tools, while users enjoy high-performing, responsive, and affordable applications.

This year, we've seen remarkable growth in AI projects flourishing on BNB Chain, including MyShell, Holoworld AI, Sleepless AI, ChainGPT, NFPrompt,, DIN, and many others. These innovative projects highlight the dynamic and thriving AI ecosystem on our platform.

This initiative led to a noticeable increase in trading volume for popular memecoins, showcasing the growing interest and participation in the ecosystem.

By blending creativity, innovation, and community-driven incentives, the Meme Innovation Battle represents a meaningful step in aligning memecoin culture with sustainable blockchain development.

BNB Chain hosted several hackathons – both online and offline in 2024. Over $2 million in prizes were given out to over 20 projects.

The BNB Chain team assisted teams with all their technical questions, supporting them through their deployment launch. All winners will have the unique opportunity for a direct interview with MVB.

BNB Chain marked significant milestones in 2024 with the successful execution of its Most Valuable Builder (MVB) Program Seasons 7 and 8, alongside the launch of the BNB Chain Incubation Alliance (BIA) to bolster Web3 project development.

The MVB Program continued to serve as a flagship initiative for fostering blockchain innovation:

In collaboration with Binance Labs, the BNB Chain Incubation Alliance was established to accelerate the growth of early-stage Web3 projects.

These initiatives exemplify BNB Chain’s commitment to cultivating a thriving blockchain ecosystem by empowering startups, fostering innovation, and driving Web3 adoption.
