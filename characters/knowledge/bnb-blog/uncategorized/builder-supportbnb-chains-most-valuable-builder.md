BNB Chain continues its mission to drive mass Web3 adoption by empowering developers at every stage of their journey. The Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program stands at the forefront of this initiative, designed to accelerate innovation and support projects shaping the future of blockchain technology, particularly in AI-driven use cases.

We’re thrilled to announce that applications for Season 9 of the MVB Program are now open! The deadline to apply is January 26, 2025, at 11:59 PM UTC. This 4-week accelerator program is a collaboration between BNB Chain, Binance Labs, and CMC Labs, offering unmatched support and resources to early-stage Web3 builders, with a strong focus on projects exploring the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence.

The MVB program has nurtured 131 projects across eight seasons, with remarkable achievements:

In Season 8, less than 7% of hundreds of applicants were admitted. 35 standout teams in DeFi, infrastructure, and AI were selected, many undergoing investment review by Binance Labs. This included groundbreaking projects leveraging AI for enhanced DeFi, AI-powered gaming experiences, and advanced AI training tools, underscoring the program’s exclusivity and impact.

We’re calling on ambitious founders to apply for MVB Season 9 and join a growing network of Web3 innovators. This program offers unparalleled opportunities to scale your project, refine your strategy, and gain exposure across the blockchain ecosystem. Together, we aim to build an AI-first blockchain ecosystem and advance decentralized AI development to benefit more users.
