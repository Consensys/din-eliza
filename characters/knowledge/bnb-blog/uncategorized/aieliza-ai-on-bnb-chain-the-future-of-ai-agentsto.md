AI agents are now capable of creating and managing wallets, issuing tokens, conducting transactions, and engaging with DeFi ecosystems.

With the rise of frameworks like Eliza, building AI agents has become more accessible than ever.

To make this even easier BNB Chain has introduced a dedicated plugin for the Eliza Framework – offering seamless integration for AI-driven on-chain operations.

Before setting up the AI agent, ensure you have the following installed:

Once configured, the AI agent is ready to interact with the BNB Chain network.

The Eliza AI Agent can execute a range of blockchain-related tasks. Below are some key demonstrations:

The AI agent can check balances and perform transactions directly on BNB Chain.

Eliza-powered AI agents can interact with DeFi protocols, enabling actions like token swaps and staking.

The AI agent can create and manage NFT collections, making it a powerful tool for NFT projects.

Eliza AI agents can bridge assets between BSC and opBNB, streamlining cross-chain transactions.

Developers working on testnet environments can request test tokens via AI-generated prompts.
