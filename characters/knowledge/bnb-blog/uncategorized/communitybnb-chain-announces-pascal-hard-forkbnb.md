BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is set to undergo the Pascal hard fork. The fork is scheduled for February 25, 2025, on the testnet and mid-March 2025 for the mainnet. Let’s break down what the fork does and the key problems it aims to solve.

The Pascal hard fork enhances BSC’s Ethereum compatibility by integrating key features from Ethereum's Pectra upgrade. Specifically:

As mentioned in BNB Chain’s 2025 tech roadmap, one of BNB Chain’s main goals is to implement the same smart contract wallet solution as EIP-7702 for enhanced account abstraction.

The Pascal fork will successfully introduce smart contract wallets, opening the doors to several new features such as:

This gives users more control and flexibility over how they manage their funds.

Pascal strengthens security by integrating BEP-439 (EIP-2537), which adds support for cryptographic operations with the BLS12-381 curve. The BLS12-381 curve is ideal for blockchain applications due to the following reasons:

Regular BNB Chain users don’t need to take any action. The upgrade will happen automatically, and most Dapps will continue functioning as expected. However, users of Dapps that are highly sensitive to gas cost changes should stay updated with announcements from those platforms.

Developers will need to ensure that their applications are compatible with the new changes. Specifically:

The Pascal hard fork is a big milestone in BNB Chain’s evolution setting the stage for the two upcoming BNB Chain forks:
