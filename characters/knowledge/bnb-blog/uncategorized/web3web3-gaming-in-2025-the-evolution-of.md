GameFi combines online gaming with decentralized finance (DeFi). It allows players to earn crypto rewards and assets while gaming, empowering developers to build in-game economies. As we move into 2025, we are seeing GameFi evolve into the more mature “Web3 Gaming” model.

Let’s look at how Web3 Gaming differs from GameFi and how Web3 gaming fits into BNB Chain’s ecosystem.

Here is how introducing blockchain-based economies and tokenized financial incentives disrupts the traditional gaming model.

The GameFi model, while disruptive, had one flaw. While the idea of earning crypto through gameplay was exciting, it often prioritized financial incentives over gameplay quality.

Fast forward to 2025, and the narrative has shifted. The industry now embraces Web3 Gaming, where ownership, player-driven economies, and fun gameplay take center stage. The focus is no longer just on earning but also on owning—with Play-to-Own (P2O) models making in-game assets truly valuable if the game itself is engaging.

As this evolution continues, we may soon drop the "Web3" label entirely.  Web3 Games will simply be "games," with blockchain abstracted away in the background. The "Fi" aspect will become a feature, not the core appeal, as true gaming experiences take priority.

There is no denying that memecoins and AI agents were the most dominant narratives in 2024. In comparison, Gaming didn’t attract that much capital.

While Web3 Gaming’s market cap isn’t among the highest, the number of wallets interacting with games hit an all-time high, reaching 50 million in 2024. So, while the games may not be as viral as memecoins, they have still attracted an impressive number of users. This is a key takeaway when assessing Gaming’s potential in 2025.

BNB Chain ranked among the top three in the number of new games announced in Q3 2024, further solidifying its status as a premier Web3 Gaming platform.

The top 3 games on BNB Chain by users are World of Dypians, SERAPH In The Darkness, and Egg Drop.

World of Dypians (WoD) is a multiplayer online role-playing game set in a vast digital world. Players can interact, complete quests, battle, and build communities while shaping the game’s evolving environment.

WoD has a huge presence on BNB Chain. Currently, 56% of its on-chain accounts are housed on BNB Chain.

SERAPH: In the Darkness is a dark fantasy action role-playing game (RPG) featuring hack-and-slash combat mechanics. It also has customizable items which can be suited to your play style. It features a diverse cast of heroes including Barbarians, Valkyries, Sorceresses, Necromancers, Angels, and Demons.

Egg Drop is a Telegram game from Gomble Games. It allows players to build and level up their collections. Via various game mechanics players can earn $G tokens and in-game rewards.

As we move into 2025, Gaming remains a key priority, serving as a crucial gateway for onboarding the next billion users into Web3. Checkout all the games currently running on the BNB Chain ecosystem here.
