Tokenization has become one of the main focus areas of BNB Chain in our mission to onboard the next billion into Web3. It is impossible to understate the sheer size of the opportunity here. As per P&S Intelligence, the “global tokenization market size was USD 3,528.6 million in 2023, and it will advance at a CAGR of 20.0% during 2024–2030, to reach USD 12,605.4 million by 2030.“

In this blog, let’s focus on tokenization in financial asset management, specifically how it can be used to improve various traditional financial instruments.

Let’s see how tokenization can help improve the following traditional financial assets:

By representing bonds as digital tokens on a blockchain, issuers, and investors can enjoy a more efficient and secure lifecycle for these financial instruments. Issuers benefit from reduced counterparty risk as blockchain enables instant delivery versus payment. This means that ownership transfers and payments are synchronized and completed simultaneously without intermediaries,

Investors gain access to smaller denominations, allowing them to diversify their portfolios without major capital outlays. The increased liquidity of tokenized bonds also ensures that secondary markets are more active, allowing investors to buy or sell their holdings more easily.

Banks and arrangers also benefit, as they reduce costs and risks through the automation of lifecycle events, such as coupon payments and redemptions.

A prime example of this innovation is Matrixdock, which has tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Matrixdock's Short-Term US Treasury Bill Token (STBT) offers risk-free yields from US Treasury securities and reverse repos. Pegged 1:1 to USD, the interest is rebased to holders’ STBT balances daily.

The tokenization of equities involves converting company shares into digital tokens, allowing for fractional ownership and simplified trading.

For issuers, the process is more efficient than traditional methods, with benefits such as automated dividend payments and streamlined share issuance.

On the other hand, investors enjoy enhanced liquidity, allowing them to trade shares more easily and in smaller amounts. The 24/7 settlement offered by tokenization means that equity transactions are not restricted by market hours, increasing convenience and accessibility.

Tokenizing commodities involves representing physical goods like gold, oil, or agricultural products as digital tokens on a blockchain. This process enhances efficiency in commodity trading by reducing settlement times, mitigating counterparty risks, and improving transparency.

Token issuers benefit from real-time traceability of commodity supply chains, allowing for greater accountability and streamlined operations.

Investors gain easy access to a diversified range of commodities without the logistical challenges of physical ownership.

For example, Matrixdock has tokenized LBMA-accredited gold on BSC. Each Matrixdock Gold (XAUm) token is backed by one fine troy ounce of high-grade LBMA physical gold, securely stored in reputable custodian vaults in Asia.

Matrixdock has tokenized LBMA-accredited gold on BSC, with each token backed by one fine troy ounce of gold, stored securely in trusted vaults in Asia.

Investment funds like mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity are also being transformed by tokenization. Issuers of tokenized funds benefit from expanded capital formation opportunities, as they can tap into previously untapped markets.

KKR’s Health Care Strategic Growth Fund is a prime example of this innovation. By tokenizing its private equity strategy through Securitize, KKR enabled investors to gain exposure to its healthcare growth equity investments.

Tokenization is transforming financial asset management with greater efficiency, accessibility, and transparency. However, the complexity of the technology involved can be a hurdle to widespread adoption.

BNB Chain solves this problem with its one-stop tokenization process, providing the tools to make tokenization simple and effective. Currently, BNB Chain offers two key solutions for tokenization:
