AI agents are autonomous systems that make decisions, solve problems, and perform tasks based on their environment and learned data.

As blockchain technology grew, developers explored how AI agents could be used in decentralized systems to automate tasks, improve user interactions, and make networks more efficient.

Early uses of AI in Web3 included decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), predictive analytics, and automated trading bots. These were useful but did not attract widespread attention. However, meme-driven projects changed this by combining humor, culture, and advanced technology, making them more engaging to a broader audience. This article explores the evolution of AI agents in Web3 and how BNB Chain supports their development with scalable solutions.

AI agents have shifted from being personality-driven to more utility-focused, combining entertainment with real-world applications.

Initially, personality-driven AI agents attracted attention through viral engagement. Now, their use extends beyond entertainment. Some AI agents automate investment strategies, while others analyze both blockchain (on-chain) and external (off-chain) data to provide market intelligence.

More AI agents with advanced capabilities are emerging, changing how people interact with blockchain and decentralized systems.

AI agents have quickly evolved to tackle real-world problems and improve efficiency.

BNB Chain is supporting AI innovation with a variety of AI agents and platforms across different sectors. These include decentralized AI consumer applications, intent agents, AI-driven market intelligence, and gaming integrations, all contributing to new use cases in Web3.

We’re seeing a diverse range of projects in the ecosystem, focusing on improving blockchain security, simplifying AI development, and enhancing interactive entertainment, helping drive the next phase of AI innovation on BNB Chain.

To support developers in building and expanding AI agents, BNB Chain provides a range of tools and resources:

ElizaOS is a versatile AI agent framework with built-in blockchain functionality. Developed with a BNB Chain Plugin, it supports multiple LLM providers and integrates with social platforms like X, Discord, and Telegram. Eliza facilitates asset management, including token transfers, swaps, and bridging.

ShellAgent developed by MyShell, ShellAgent simplifies AI agent creation with a no-code Classic Mode, allowing users to build and deploy AI models with minimal effort. It supports multi-model integration and features a dedicated AI agent marketplace for monetization.

TermiX offers pluggable AI components for creating custom workflows. Its low-code drag-and-drop interface makes it accessible for beginners, while its on-chain operations ensure decentralized execution. TermiX also enables AI tokenization, allowing developers to monetize their creations.

Revox.ai focuses on AI-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. It enables users to create AI-driven trading strategies, market analysis tools, and financial automation systems, optimizing efficiency in blockchain-based financial operations.

Eternal AI is a decentralized AI network where you can create and chat with humanity's greatest minds using advanced AI technology.

Jam.ai is a cyber squirrel that helps people create their favorite AI Agent on BNB Chain.

BNB Chain is committed to AI as a long-term driver of Web3 innovation. To accelerate AI adoption within our ecosystem, we’ve launched two key initiatives:

AI agents in Web3 are shifting from entertainment-focused tools to more advanced systems that improve blockchain efficiency, market analysis, and user interaction. BNB Chain supports this development by offering infrastructure and tools for developers to create and scale AI-driven solutions in a decentralized environment.
