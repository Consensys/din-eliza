A sandwich attack is a form of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation where an attacker front-runs and back-runs a user’s trade to profit from price movement. Here are some terms you should know before we proceed:

In this guide, let’s understand how they work and learn how BNB Chain protects its users from this attack vector.

End Goal: The attacker forces the victim to buy at a worse rate while the attacker capitalizes on the artificial price movement.

This attack is commonly seen in decentralized exchanges that use automated market makers (AMMs). AMMs are majorly dependent on liquidity pools, and sudden price shifts can greatly impact overall trade execution.

As you can understand, the implications of these attacks are quite extreme. They distort trades for everyday retail users, making DeFi markets less attractive for honest traders.

Here are some more sandwich attack strategies, as shown in “A Study on Blockchain Sandwich Attack Strategies Based on Mechanism Design Game Theory.”

BNB Chain has implemented multiple measures to protect traders from sandwich attacks.

BNB Chain has partnered with the following major wallet providers to integrate built-in MEV protection, allowing users to transact securely without additional setup:

For users with wallets that do not offer native MEV protection – such as MetaMask – BNB Chain supports manual protection via private RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services. Currently, BNB Chain has the following free private RPC services:

For institutional traders and Dapp developers, BNB Chain offers customizable MEV protection solutions through third-party service providers.

The BNB Chain community remains committed to eliminating malicious MEV attack vectors. As mentioned in the 2025 roadmap, reducing MEV attacks is a top priority for the BNB Chain core team, with a key focus on cutting block times to under 1 second, minimizing the window for exploitation. Through ongoing infrastructure improvements and innovation, BNB Chain continues to enhance security and fairness for all users.
