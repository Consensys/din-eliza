BNB Chain 在 2024 年推出了 Megafuel 方案，基于提议者-构建者分离（PBS）机制，目前已支持超过 2500 万笔零 Gas 费的稳定币交易，覆盖逾 1600 万用户。

2025 年，BNB Chain 将进一步优化 Gas 机制，支持更多类型的交易享受零 Gas费，包括来自EOA地址的交易。除了BNB, 用户也将可使用稳定币或其他类型的BEP-20代币支付Gas, 完成链上交互。此外，还将推出基于EIP-7702的Paymaster 机制，使企业或项目方能够为用户提供 Gas 费用赞助，降低用户进入 Web3 生态的门槛。

BNB Chain 在 2024 年推出基于 PBS 架构的恶意 MEV 防护机制，与Binance Wallet、Trust Wallet、OKX Wallet，TokenPocket，和Safepal等生态的头部钱包合作，整合钱包自动MEV保护功能。可有效减少交易操纵风险，尤其帮助用户防范“三明治”攻击。

BNB Chain 计划推出类似 EIP-7702 的智能钱包（Smart Wallet）解决方案，优化密钥管理方式，简化用户使用门槛；支持批量交易，提高交互效率；此外将整合 Gas 赞助机制，使项目方或 DApp 更便捷地承担用户的 Gas 费用。

2024年初开始，AI与Web3的协同成为BNB Chain的重点，打造AI First的BNB Chain。2024 年，BNB Chain 已吸引超过 60 个 AI 相关项目，涵盖数据基建和 AI Agent平台、AI 游戏、AI 社交及 AI DeFi 等应用领域。
