Malicious MEV continues to impact traders and challenge the fairness of DeFi, leading to significant losses across the ecosystem.

Malicious MEV undermines the fairness and efficiency of BNB Chain and the decentralized digital ledger world. Many users, especially retail altcoin traders, have suffered from Sandwich attacks and lost hundreds of millions of dollars. The BNB Chain community is actively exploring ways to mitigate the impact of malicious MEV and enhance fairness in DeFi.

As a community, we believe BNB Chain can take a unique approach to reducing malicious MEV. It is important to work together to discourage, mitigate, and even penalize those who facilitate or introduce harmful MEV practices. All infrastructure participants—including block builders, RPC nodes, validators, and DApps—should implement measures to detect and prevent malicious MEV. Validators, in particular, as block proposers and key beneficiaries of commissions, have a responsibility to help protect users from such exploits.

We suggest that the BNB community should take all technology and non-technology weapons to reduce malicious MEV, such as:

In 2025, a new BEP (BNB Evolution Proposals) will be introduced to technically reduce transaction exposures and improve mempool efficiency.
