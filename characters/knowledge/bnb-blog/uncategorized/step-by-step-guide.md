Memecoins remain one of the most enduring phenomena in crypto because of the way it combines humor, culture, and community engagement with blockchain technology. Recently, we published a blog highlighting the key considerations for creating your own memecoin.

Today, we're taking it a step further. In this blog, we’ll show you the specific, actionable steps and strategies you can take to successfully launch a memecoin on BNB Chain.

You can find multiple meme launchpads on our Memecoin Solution page and create your meme coins.

Here are three approaches you can take to launch your meme tokens:

A bonding curve launchpad is a decentralized mechanism where tokens are minted and sold based on a price curve. This method ensures fair distribution and price discovery. In this example, we will be using the Four.meme platform.

Visit the Four.Meme platform and connect your wallet to get started. You can choose from a variety of wallets that support the BNB Chain and the Four.Meme platform, such as Binance Wallet (integrated with the Binance app; download the Binance app for access), Trust Wallet, or any other compatible wallet. Ensure your wallet is funded and ready for transactions to proceed seamlessly.

Next, complete the required fields on the [Create Token] page as follows:

Now, your token will be list on the board. When the Bonding curve hits 100%, the liquidity pool will automatically be created on PancakeSwap.

You can use a prelaunch platform like Pinksale to launch your memecoins. This is what you need to do. Launching a presale on Pinksale is a streamlined process that allows you to raise funds, build a community, and prepare your token for a successful launch.

To begin, visit the Pinksale platform and connect your wallet. You can use wallets that are compatible with the BNB Chain, like Trust Wallet. Once your wallet is connected, select "Launchpads" followed by "Create Presale."

If you already have a token, input its address to link it to the presale. If not, you can create a new token directly on the platform. Specify the currency you want to use for fundraising—BNB is the default option, but you can also choose stablecoins for your presale by following this guide.

Next, select a fee option and determine whether you want auto-listing (where liquidity is added automatically after finalization) or manual listing (where you manage liquidity addition manually).

In this step, you will define the parameters of your presale. Key details to input include:

Review the calculated total tokens required for the presale, which will appear above the navigation buttons. You can also use the Pinksale Calculator to optimize your tokenomics. Once all parameters are set, click "Next" to continue.

Upload a logo URL and input your project’s official website link. Also add in relevant social media information.

In the final step, review all the details entered during the previous steps. This is your last opportunity to make any necessary changes.

If everything looks correct, click "Approve Spending Token" to authorize Pinksale to use the required tokens for the presale. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and click "Submit" to finalize the presale setup.

Once submitted, your wallet will prompt you to confirm a transaction fee. After approving the fee, your presale will go live on Pinksale. The platform will display the presale link, which you can share with your community to start attracting contributors.

Let’s see how you can deploy a memecoin by setting up a liquidity pool.

Before deploying your token, ensure you have all the critical details finalized:

To simplify deployment, choose a launchpad platform like Four.Meme, We have explained to you how the platform works in “Approach #1.” They also provide business development support to guide you through the deployment process. You may reach out to the following for assistance:

Once the Token Generation Event (TGE) occurs, a portion of your tokens should be designated as circulating supply. These tokens will be automatically added to a liquidity pool.

To build investor confidence and ensure long-term project stability, lock certain portions of your tokens.

Liquidity pools (LP) generate revenue from transaction fees. Currently, LP revenue distribution requires manual execution.

Market Makers (MMs) play a crucial role in ensuring liquidity pool performance. Designate a reliable MM to:

To increase visibility and accessibility, list your token on reputable information platforms.

We strongly recommend that projects have their coin contracts audited and the fair launch and distribution methods should be public to the community.

The three approaches outlined above provide a comprehensive roadmap for launching your new memecoin successfully. If you are stumped while creating your “$TRUMP” feel free to reach out to BNB Chain’s BD team for 1-1 guidance.
