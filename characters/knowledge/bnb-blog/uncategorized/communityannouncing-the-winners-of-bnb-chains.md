February 7-9, 2025, BNB Chain had the privilege of being one of the main sponsors of ETH Oxford, held at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University. During the event, BNB Chain hosted a hacker house, specifically for developers working on BNB Chain projects.

A crypto-ai suite that simplifies blockchain interactions with a natural language bot

A decentralized peer review system that transforms opaque scientific evaluations into a transparent, accessible process

Honourable Mentions: BNBShield, CloutDrop, AADC (AI Agents for DeFi & Cross-Chain Operations), and Wired.

The hacker house mainly focussed on two areas—Decentralized Science (DeSci) and AI

However, the devs were encouraged to explore and build freely, guided by their own research and vision.

The hacker house also had a fun little photo contest. Here are the top 3 winners:

Thank you to everyone who participated, and - once again - congratulations to all the winners! BNB Chain is honored to have hosted this event and to have served as a key sponsor of ETH Oxford. Stay tuned for more exciting events in the future.
