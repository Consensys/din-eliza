Start your year with exciting rewards! From January 27, 2025, to February 17, 2025, join us for a three-week-long celebration, the Red Envelope Carnival: Share $300K+ Tokens.

A red envelope is a traditional gift in Chinese culture, typically given during significant events like the New Year. It contains money and symbolizes good luck, prosperity, and happiness. The red color represents energy and blessings, and the act of giving red envelopes is believed to ward off bad luck and bring good fortune to the recipient. To celebrate the 2025 New Year and honor various cultural traditions, we're offering rewards of $300K as a gesture of good luck and prosperity for all.

Here's everything you need to know to participate and win your share of 300K+!

Each week, 5-6 new projects will design unique tasks for you to complete. The more tasks you complete, the more points you earn, increasing your chances of receiving higher-value token rewards. Simply connect your wallet on the campaign page to get started!

Each week, a task from the Partner Task Zone will be highlighted as a 'Limited Time Task' for 2 days. Completing this task will earn you 200 points instantly—double the points of a regular partner task.

In addition, participants who complete the Limited Time Task will be eligible for extra rewards provided by the featured project. More details about these rewards will be shared on its featured day by the respective project on the day it’s featured.

BNB Chain has also prepared official tasks for all participants. Each task is worth 100 points.

Visit the campaign page and Start your New Year journey with us on January 27, 2025! Don’t forget to complete tasks, and check in daily. Let’s celebrate together and make this New Year unforgettable!
