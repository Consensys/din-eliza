In response to the call to reduce malicious MEV attacks and other community actions in good will to help with the BNB ecosystem's growth and development, the BNB Chain core community now unites several prominent members to launch the BNB Good Will Alliance.

BNB Good Will Alliance is established to coordinate off-chain efforts to initiate creative ideas, best practices, and ethical standards that serve the best interests of BNB holders and all participants in the BNB ecosystem. These coordinations are expected to become a more widely accepted consensus via BNB governance, BEPs, and BNB Chain code.

The first initiative of the alliance is to aggressively push for the reduction of Sandwich Attacks on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The two key builders in BNB Chainâ€™s infrastructure, BlockRazor, and 48 Club, have now deployed their Sandwich Attack filters onto their block building mechanism. These builders now form the first batch of Builders in this initiative. To respond to this good will action, we call for all BSC builders to join this initiative to filter Sandwich Attacks with their best efforts.

We have created a repository on GitHub for the alliance, with MEV good will builders in a dedicated folder. We call for all BSC validators to now only accept block bids from builders included in this folder.

We will work with the members of the alliance to perform further actions to resist Sandwich Attacks, including:

In the near future, we will work with more alliance members to introduce more good will initiatives to bring more benefits to the community. Stay tuned for further updates!
