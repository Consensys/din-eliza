I am Elia, Community manager of REVOX. REVOX is a modular onchain AI network, committed to building AI Agent infrastructure, providing developers and users with complete solutions for DeFi, AI asset issuance, and AI applications.

Q2. How is REVOX making its AI Agents accessible to users who might not have a technical background in blockchain or AI? What initiatives are in place to drive adoption?

The core point is to combine data sources and necessary plugins (such as Twitter search plugins, Google Trend plugins) with trading-related elements. This is the direction we are developing. We hope to enable more new investors to enter the entire Web3 ecosystem, bringing in new funds. This will be a good thing for the entire industry.In addition, we further help developers connect the results of their development with the community. This is very different from the development methods of some centralized applications.REVOX's flagship super-app Web3 GPT Lense and Smart Wallet have already garnered over 21 million users worldwide. Our AI Applications simplify users experience in Web3, assisting users with investment decisions, asset allocation, enhance productivity. We will soon also see AI Virtual Avatars offering daily assistance or any kinds of support.The usage of the Agents is also incentivized through our Points system, staking and other mechanisms as our S2 Airdrop is underway.

Q3. What specifically does an AI agent do on REVOX's blockchain network?

Our AI Applications simplify users experience in Web3: For example, with the Smart Wallet, https://lense.revox.ai/wallet the AI assists users with their personal finance, investment decisions, asset allocation, identifying lucrative opportunities, swapping, bridging, trading perpetuals. The REVOX AI Agent launchpad will also be ready soon and our token will be the core asset to fund the creative ideas of early-stage AI Agent developers.AI can be incorporated into various tools to enhance productivity also. For instance, AI-powered meeting assistants can streamline collaboration and improve efficiency. There’s no limit really to what AI can do with our plugins (current and developing), the only limit is our imagination!At the moment, our team is working towards creating the first Virtual Avatar you can see and interact with. Such AI-powered entities could take the form of friends, family members, or even a digital version of oneself. We will be seeing enough development in that field soon, and we’re happy to pioneer the way for the next generation of AI developers.

Q4. How can users leverage on your platform to create AI Agents?

It’s very simple really, a user could just write in their preferred natural language what they wish the AI Agent to do in the ‘Prompt’ section, and then choose the related plugins to enable the Agent to perform tasks rather than just chat.

We have created a Chatbot talking like Elon Musk as a simple example for people to follow: https://readon-me.gitbook.io/revox-studio-guild/revox-studio-overview/basic-functions-of-revox-studio, but of course, a more experienced AI developer can add any of the available plugins and create an Agent with many functionalities, and more plugins are underway.

First of all, our token will have the new functions we have been planning. We hope that our token can become a core asset for the AI Agent launchpad, used to fund the creative ideas of early-stage developers.

Secondly, we want to develop the AI Agent Virtual Avatars, such as virtual assistants or virtual friends, to further complete the AI product puzzle. Of course, there's also the investment assistant we mentioned earlier. These are a few of our key development goals that we're mainly focusing on now.

Q6. What are some last words you want to share with the community? Feel free to share your socials.

I want to thank you for inviting us here today first of all. BNBChain has been a key partner in our journey and we're very grateful to have such partners and build on opBNB and BNBChain, because the nature of the network is a perfect fit for our development and AI in general in many sectors.

Then I’d wish to thank everyone for participating in this AMA, and invite you all to check out our tools and join our community on X and Discord. We will be happy to meet you all there and help you get started with REVOX. https://x.com/readonme3https://discord.gg/readon It was a pleasure to be here today and I’m hoping to meet again!
