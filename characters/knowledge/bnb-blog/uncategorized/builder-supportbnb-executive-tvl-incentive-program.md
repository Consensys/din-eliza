We are thrilled to introduce the next evolution of our TVL Incentive Program #5, centered around BNB staking, liquid staking, and restaking on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). This initiative invites related protocols to compete during the campaign period, with the top 5 qualifying projects receiving direct BNB staking support from the BNB Chain Foundation.

This campaign which dedicates up to 5% of incremental staked BNB per protocol as Delegation Support, represents BNB Chain’s commitment to fostering growth in the DeFi and restaking ecosystems and builds on KernelDAO’s recent announcement of a $40M fund allocation dedicated to expanding restaking on BNB Chain.

Delegation supports increments of up to 5% of the staked BNB, capped at 20,000 BNB per protocol. The total campaign has a hard cap of 50,000 BNB.

BNB Chain will provide BNB delegation support to the Top 5 performing protocols, amounting to up to 5% of the incremental TVL (staked BNB only) achieved during the campaign. This staking support will be up to 20,000 BNB per protocol, and 50,000 BNB in total. In essence, the greater the incremental TVL, the larger the amount of BNB staked by BNB Chain Foundation. Additionally, the higher your project ranks based on the metrics below, the greater share of the staking support you will receive! BNB Chain will encourage protocols to launch rewards and incentive campaigns to offer more benefits for users.

All qualified participants will be ranked according to these 4 indicators and weights, and the top 5 protocols will receive Delegation support up to 5% of their staked BNB increments.

Staked BNB includes all BNB staked, restaked, and yield-related derivatives, including LRTs.

*Please note that the final allocation of BNB Delegation support among the Top 5 protocols will be evaluated based on the overall performance and security/risk management measures of each protocol.

The TVL Incentive Program #5 is open to applications from all protocols related to Staked BNB. Eligible participants include key protocols focused on liquid staking, restaking infrastructure, liquid restaking, and yield optimization protocols.

To qualify for Delegation Support, the top 5 protocols must meet the following benchmarks:

All requirements must be fulfilled by the end of the campaign, ensuring that the aforementioned conditions are satisfied before the winners are announced and before BNB Chain delegates any BNB.

As we kick off this exciting new chapter of the TVL Incentive Program, we invite protocols to rise to the challenge and showcase their innovation in BNB staking, liquid staking, and restaking. This initiative not only strengthens the DeFi and restaking ecosystems on the BNB Chain but also reinforces our commitment to empowering projects that drive meaningful growth and adoption.
