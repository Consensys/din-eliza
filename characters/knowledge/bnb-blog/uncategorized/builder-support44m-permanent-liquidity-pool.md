Starting on March 13, 2025, BNB Chain will kick off the second round of the "$4.4M Permanent Liquidity Support". This initiative aims to elevate native assets on BSC by rewarding top-performing projects.

Through this campaign, standout assets will be spotlighted daily and weekly, with the BNB Chain Foundation injecting permanent BNB liquidity into the pools of winning projects. This liquidity is non-withdrawable, ensuring long-term support for the ecosystem’s most promising assets.

In this round, participation is no longer limited to memecoins—all sector assets on BSC are eligible, with no category restrictions. The competition will be split into two parts: daily and weekly. The daily competition will be divided into zones, with each asset placed in the appropriate zone based on its market cap, ensuring a fair and competitive environment for projects of all sizes.

Only assets that meet the conditions below can join this competition and be displayed on the leaderboard.

If a project is reported for rug-pulling or past market manipulation, please report it to us. We will investigate, and if verified, the project will be disqualified from the competition.

This campaign will feature daily and weekly sector-based competitions, ensuring fair visibility and engagement across different asset categories.

The daily competition will be divided into two different zones based on the asset’s market cap: Burst Zone and Mature Zone. Assets that meet the above participating conditions will automatically enter the different zones to join the competition. Daily winners will not be awarded multiple times. However, they can still participate in weekly competitions to compete for higher prizes.

Any assets that meet the above participation conditions can join the weekly competition, even if they are a daily winner.

Each zone will be ranked according to its independent indicators and weights. Daily winners cannot win the award repeatedly but can compete for the weekly competition rewards.

To WIN the daily and weekly competitions, assets must meet ALL of the following conditions:

Timeline for Liquidity Support:After verifying the winner's benchmark, BNB Chain will announce the winner on X. The liquidity support will be completed within 10 days following the announcement.

Double-Sided or Single-Sided Liquidity Addition:Liquidity will be flexibly added to the winner’s most active liquidity pool.Please note that there is a time difference between swapping the token and adding the LP, which causes a difference in amounts.

Withdrawal of Liquidity:The liquidity support provided will remain permanently in the pool and cannot be withdrawn, ensuring lasting support for the winning projects.
