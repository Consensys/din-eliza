One of the biggest concerns in the DeFi space has been the impact of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks—especially sandwich attacks—that lead to unfair trading conditions and financial losses for users.

To help address this issue, we’re excited to introduce three MEV protection solutions today in collaboration with leading wallet providers. These solutions will help users safeguard their transactions against sandwich attacks and enjoy a safer DeFi trading experience.

A sandwich attack is a form of front-running where malicious bots manipulate the price of an asset by placing two transactions around a trader’s swap order on a decentralized exchange (DEX). This results in users receiving worse trade execution prices, leading to losses.

To combat this, we’ve partnered with multiple wallets and private transaction service providers to introduce MEV Protection. Depending on your needs, you can choose from three different solutions:

Best for: Everyday on-chain users who want a simple and automatic solution

Major wallet providers have integrated MEV Protection directly into their swap features. If you use any of the following wallets, your transactions are automatically protected from sandwich attacks when swapping within the wallet:

For OKX Wallet and TokenPocket Wallet, follow similar steps via their respective settings. Binance Web3 Wallet has MEV Protection enabled by default, requiring no additional setup.

Best for: Users of MetaMask and other wallets without built-in MEV Protection

If your wallet doesn’t offer automatic MEV Protection, you can still protect your transactions by using a private RPC (Remote Procedure Call). This sends your transactions through a private network, making them invisible to MEV bots.

Currently, three free private RPC services on BNB Chain offer sandwich attack protection:

This is an easy and free way to prevent sandwich attacks, even if your wallet doesn’t have built-in MEV Protection.

Best for: Dapp developers, institutional traders, and professional users who need customized protection.

For those seeking more advanced protection and transaction privacy, several service providers offer paid MEV protection solutions with additional features such as faster execution times and atomic bundling.

These solutions provide an extra security layer for those needing customized MEV Protection.

We know that MEV attacks have been a longstanding challenge in DeFi, and we’re committed to making BNB Chain a safer, more user-friendly ecosystem. By partnering with wallet providers and industry experts, we hope these solutions will give users more control and protection over their transactions.

As always, we appreciate your feedback and are constantly working on ways to improve the experience for everyone in our community. Let us know if you have any thoughts, and stay tuned for more updates!
