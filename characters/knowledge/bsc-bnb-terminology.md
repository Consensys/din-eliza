# BSC and BNB Chain Terminology Guide

This document explains the relationship between different terms used to refer to the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

## Term Equivalency

The following terms are used interchangeably and refer to the same blockchain ecosystem:

- **BSC** (Binance Smart Chain)
- **BNB Chain**
- **BNBChain**
- **BNB**

## Historical Context

Originally launched as "Binance Smart Chain" (BSC) in September 2020, this blockchain was designed to run smart contract-based applications with compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

In February 2022, Binance announced a rebranding from "Binance Smart Chain (BSC)" to "BNB Chain." This rebranding aligned the blockchain more closely with its native token, BNB.

## Current Terminology

The official name is now "BNB Chain," but many developers, validators, and community members still use "BSC" when referring to this blockchain. Both terms are acceptable and widely understood within the ecosystem.

### Why Different Terms Are Used

1. **Historical Usage**: Many early developers and tools were built using "BSC" terminology
2. **Technical Documentation**: Older documentation and code repositories still use "BSC" in many places
3. **Community Adoption**: The community adopted both terms at different times
4. **Official Evolution**: The official branding gradually shifted from BSC to BNB Chain

## Components of the Ecosystem

The BNB Chain ecosystem consists of:

- **BNB Beacon Chain** (formerly Binance Chain): Used for BNB staking and voting
- **BNB Smart Chain** (formerly Binance Smart Chain): EVM-compatible blockchain for smart contracts
- **BNB Sidechain**: Framework for building application-specific sidechains

## Technical Identifiers

When working with node software, RPC endpoints, or configuration files, you might encounter both naming conventions:

- GitHub repositories: Both `bnb-chain/bsc` and newer repositories using `bnb-chain`
- ChainID: 56 (mainnet), 97 (testnet) - these remain unchanged regardless of naming
- RPC Endpoints: May use either bsc or bnb in their URLs

## Usage Guidelines

When communicating about this blockchain:

- Both "BSC" and "BNB Chain" are correct and refer to the same blockchain
- In technical contexts, "BSC" is still commonly used, especially in node operation
- In marketing or official communications, "BNB Chain" is the preferred term
- When reading documentation, be aware that both terms reference the same technology
