## Description

How do I determine which validator the next block is?
https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/issues/1123
I've seen it stated here that it is, polling by blocks of 200, who the next verifier will be. But when I open the block of 400, when I look at 401, it's not Validator 1 to pack, why is this what?
