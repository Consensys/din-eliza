## Description

Hello Team,  

Good Day!  

We have successfully configured the **wallet setup** on our server. However, yesterday, we detected **suspicious activity** on our **wallet server** involving the following address: **0x1F2FAa922179f6a6178f93fA2CcBB90a5bbd948b**, occurring on the **same block number**.  

Could you please investigate and provide a solution **ASAP**?  

Thanks in advance!  ## Comments
