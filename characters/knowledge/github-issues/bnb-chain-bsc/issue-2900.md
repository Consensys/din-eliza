## Description

Hi

I found this transaction that paid a really really low fee. But as far as i know, its not possible to use a gas price below 1Gwei.

How happened and how was it done?

Mainly, almost all transactions from the wallet below usually makes transactions from 1 to 9 wei only

Also, bscscan shows the wallet creator

Funded By
0x029B804e...5d92A0212
at txn

If you click in the wallet creator address, you will see that the creator of his creator was a wallet marked as phishing

So... it looks very unfair.. it looks like someone involved with phishing is exploiting the system to buy new tokens with an almost free price.

Is that right?

Does anyone have any idea how it is being performed?## Comments
